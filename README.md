# Smart Garden Automation System

This project automates garden care using real-time soil humidity data and remote control features. It’s designed to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth with minimal manual intervention.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Watering**  
  Humidity sensors continuously monitor the soil. When moisture drops below a defined optimal threshold, the watering system is automatically activated.

- **Rain Protection (Cover Control)**  
  If the humidity rises above a defined maximum level (e.g., due to heavy rain), a protective cover system automatically closes to shield the plants.

- **Remote Monitoring & Control**  
  Users can:
  - Monitor soil humidity levels  
  - Trigger watering manually  
  - Open/close the garden cover  
  — all via an internet-connected interface.

## Technologies Used

- Humidity sensors  
- Actuators for watering and cover mechanisms  
- **Arduino** for sensor control and automation logic  
- **Raspberry Pi** for internet connectivity and remote interface  
- Web or mobile interface for remote access
